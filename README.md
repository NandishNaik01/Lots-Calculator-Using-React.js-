### Introduction

#### This web project uniquely addresses the problem of calculating trade sizes based on your daily risk and per-trade risk, while considering your total capital. It can suggest sizes in lots or individual units.

### Usage Instructions

There are four input fields:

- **Risk per trade**
- **Trades per day**
- **Option price**

Fill in these input fields as shown in the above image.

Once filled, you will be able to see:

- The total amount of risk you can take on a single trade.
- The total number of lots you can buy in that particular trade.
- The total number of individual units of the total lots.

### Contributing

Currently, the web application fulfills its primary purpose, but there are some features we can add to enhance its functionality:

- **Dynamic Option Selection**: Instead of requiring the user to manually input the option prices, we can allow users to choose the appropriate option from a list. This is particularly useful since option prices are dynamic and constantly changing.
- **API Integration**: By integrating with an API to fetch real-time option prices, we can automatically update the values based on the selected option strike. This will make the process more efficient and reduce the time required for manual input.
